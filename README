Remove my sub directories (yahoo.com, etc)


Immediate To Do:
1) Inspect certificate for other names
2) At end of execution (end of main) remove the .resource files from the main directory
3) Check subbrute.py results against the wordlist I used - sometimes it returns ALL valid, whih is B.S.  Check for that and abort if it happens




4) Use DNSRecon to find subs



I should auto-run my sub enumeration every 25 hours or so and diff the resulting data.
Any differences that are observed should trigger an e-mail to me to let me know what was found.

I'll then need to follow that up witha  cronjob to move the resource file into a storage location, since they
are automatically created within the pwd of my script.  Let's not let it get too messy...
