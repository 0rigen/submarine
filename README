Remove my sub directories (yahoo.com, etc)
At end of execution (end of main) remove the .resource files from the main directory.


2) Inspect certificate for other names

4) Use DNSRecon to find subs



I should auto-run my sub enumeration every 25 hours or so and diff the resulting data.
Any differences that are observed should trigger an e-mail to me to let me know what was found.

I'll then need to follow that up witha  cronjob to move the resource file into a storage location, since they
are automatically created within the pwd of my script.  Let's not let it get too messy...
