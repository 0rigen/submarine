1) Use VirusTotal API to search for subdomains
2) Inspect certificate for other names
3) Use subbrute.py to brute force it
4) Use DNSRecon to find subs
5) Save output to a file for now



It looks like running enumall.sh will create a timestampe (down to the day) resource file for recon-ng.
I should auto-run my sub enumeration every 25 hours or so and diff the resulting data.
Any differences that are observed should trigger an e-mail to me to let me know what was found.

I'll then need to follow that up witha  cronjob to move the resource file into a storage location, since they
are automatically created within the pwd of my script.  Let's not let it get too messy...
